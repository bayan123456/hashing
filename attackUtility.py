    Simulate a dictionary attack against the in-memory user_db.

    Parameters
    ----------
    username : str
        Target username to attack (must exist in user_db).
    user_db : dict
        The USERS structure from app.py, or any similar dict

    max_attempts : int, optional

    Returns
    -------
    DictionaryAttackResult

        which passwords were tried, and any extra notes.
